# Crush Propose Website

This project is a fun and interactive website that allows users to propose to their crush, where the answer is always "Yes"! The site is designed so that the "No" button is nearly impossible to click, ensuring the proposal gets the right response every time. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a smooth and playful user experience.

## Features

- **Impossible "No" Button**: The "No" button moves away whenever hovered, ensuring the crush can't reject the proposal.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on mobile and desktop.
- **Simple User Interface**: Designed with minimalism and ease of use in mind.
